		<div class='fade-in title'>About application</div>
		<div class="fade-in simple-text">
			Actually it's a project from yandex lyceum<br>
			I had no idea about projects so I just took my '<a href="https://anoobisthegod.github.io/site/projects/flutter.html">rng</a>' app and turned it into pyqt app<br>
			So features in there are like same as in rng app so read about it first<br>
		</div>
		<div class='fade-in title'>Here I will tell u what did I add and what did I remove:</div>
		<div class="fade-in simple-text">
		<div class="commands pyqt">
			<div class="command-title">Nearly full theme customisation</div>
			There is NO customisation cause there is qt and its really hard to customize so I decided not to do it.
			<div class="dividor"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="commands pyqt">
			<div class="command-title">Randomisator</div>
			There is no randomisator cause idea of the app is to create helper for school and in school u don't need ot generate random numbers so I removed them
			<div class="dividor"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="commands pyqt">
				<div class="command-title">Math IT and Chemistry</div>
				In Math I added graphics builder and button that will do os.system('calc') and it will open standart windows calc)<br>
				In IT and chemistry there r no changes
				<div class="dividor"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="commands pyqt">
			<div class="command-title">Updates</div>
			I don't think I will update this app cause Qt in comparison with flutter is nothing cause u can use flutter like everywhere and for
			PyQt u need pc and some Python libraries(idk how to convert my app to .exe)
