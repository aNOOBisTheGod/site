		<div class="fade-in simple-text">
			I started to create it when I was at lksh camp(2021, august)<br>
			The idea was to create beauty app with theme settings that will generate random numbers, rng = random numbers generator<br>
			I decided to do it cause i wanted to practice my flutter developing skills<br>
			But when I returned home I started to add more and more features to that app cause it was with nivce theme customisation and I was too lazy
			to create new one app, so it turned into app with a lot of features(multi tool app))<br>
			There are freatures like in discord bot but it's an app so yeah im genius<br>
			It helps me a lot to become better in flutter so im quite proud of this app)<br>
			And btw this â†‘ is not app icon, app just has no icon so I decided to use that image like its a very meme
