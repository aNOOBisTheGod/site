			I made this bot just for fun when I wanted to know how to work with telegram bots.<br>
			This bot isn't hosted anywhere so it's quite useless but idk why I decided to include it in my best projects list. 
			Maybe that's bescause im stupid))<br>
			As I said I made this bot for fun, it took me like 2-3 hours, it uses Python libraries like
			requests(to solve chemistry equations) and opencv(to offence you when you sends him face))<br>
			Bot has functions like discord bot but less and I made them like in really strange way so it can works like idek<br>

		<div class='fade-in title'>About commands</div>

			But here are them all(u can view them by typing /help)
